# ServiceDesk
<div>
End-of-semester project on programming computational solutions.
<p>The challenge was to create a Java interface with CRUD, representing an improvement or innovation of any existing application, and my solution was to develop a service desk for a transport company application in order to improve user support in the application .</p>

<p>This is a GUI Bug Tracker application developed using Java Swing. It allows users to submit bug reports with options for severity and frequency, and provides functionality to manage a list of employees and their assigned bug codes.</p>
</div>

<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bug submission: Users can enter their name, select severity and frequency options, and submit bug reports.</li>
<li>Bug Code Generation: Based on the severity and frequency options selected, a unique bug code is generated for each bug report.</li>
<li>Employee Management: Users can add, edit and delete employee records including name, registration number and bug code assignment.</li>
<li>Bug Report Status: Users can view the status of bug reports by entering an employee's name and bug code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher</li>
<li>Apache Maven</li>
</ul>

 <p>The program shows the app view for the user (cell phone screen) where he will make the call, and the second screen (notebook) simulates the system on the company side, where the area manager will register the employees who will monitor and resolve the call, and it is also possible to generate reports to track the status of the activity</p>
